# Zero-Shot-Learning-With-Image-Classification

#  Image Classification Using Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL):

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of **Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)** for image classification. ZSL is an advanced machine learning technique that enables models to recognize unseen classes based on semantic information, without needing training data for those specific classes.


##  Project Overview:

Traditional image classification models require labeled examples for each class. However, Zero-Shot Learning enables classification of **unseen categories** by leveraging auxiliary information (e.g., semantic embeddings or class attributes). This project demonstrates how ZSL can be applied to image data using a combination of feature extraction and semantic matching.


## Key Concepts Covered:

- Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) theory and types (inductive vs. transductive)
- Preprocessing and feature extraction using CNNs (e.g., ResNet/VGG)
- Use of semantic embeddings (e.g., word2vec, GloVe)
- Evaluation on seen vs. unseen class predictions
- Visualization of predictions and accuracy
